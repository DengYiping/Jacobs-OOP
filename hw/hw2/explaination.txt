a) The error message simply informs the programmer that "string", "cout","endl" is not defined in the scope. 
Because "string", "cout", "endl" is defined in the namespace std, and the line "using namespace std;" simply bring all the definiton of std into the current scope.
Without it, we need to explicitly use "std::string", "std::cout", "std::endl" to access these definitions.


b) The erro message says that name is not defined in the scope. Clearly, "name" is a private member in the Critter class definition. Without "Critter::", the function definition is just a normal function definition.
It does not represent the public method in Critter class. Clearly, it will not compile and the name is not in the scope.
One possible solution is to write the class method implementation in the header file,
in the class public areas.
